# Bitcoin_Private_Key_Generator_From_Text_Input



Write one or more sentences in "TEXT_INPUT.txt" file to generate private key .


    At least use 20 characters except spaces.
--> It is recommended to write minimum 40 characters except spaces to ensure strong encryption.
    If you use too short sentences, it will be easy to predict your private key and your bitcoin could be stolen.


Use below characters. Other characters are not valid.
-----------------------------------------------------
  A-Z English letters
  a-z English letters
  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 numbers
  . (dot)
  , (comma)
  ' (apostrophe) [not advised]
-----------------------------------------------------

" '(apostrophe) " may cause typo. It is not adviced to use.
If you forget you used the abrevated auxiliary verbs, you can't generate correct private key from your wrong sentences.


After private key generation completed, write your sentences any paper.

When you wrote your private key (and sentences) to a paper;
Delete "TEXT_INPUT.txt" file.
Delete "BITCOIN KEYS.txt" file.
Empty your recycling bin.
Don't store "TEXT_INPUT.txt" and "BITCOIN KEYS.txt" files in your computer.

Don't store this files and private key at phone as photograph.
Don't store this files and private key at cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive etc.
Don't share this files and private key with anyone.

You can share your public key (bitcoin address), not private key (sentences).
